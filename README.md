# docker-compose-mongodb
MongoDB with Docker and Docker Compose

## Usage (start server)

On folder that contains `docker-compose.yml` type one of this.

```
// non detach mode
docker-compose up
```
or
```
// detach mode
docker-compose up -d
```

It will spin the MongoDB latest version (currently 4.x.x version), expose port to host at 27017.

## Usage (stop server)

To shutdown database without remove the container.

```
docker-compose stop
```

To shutdown database and remove the container.
```
docker-compose down
```

Is data or user that already created will gone? No, since in the Docker Compose file you can see that we utilize data container named `mongodb_data_container` to store the MongoDB data.

## MongoDB credential (for database `admin`)

- Username: root
- Password: rootpassword

## How to connect to MongoDB

### Via mongo Shell

Type this.

```
mongo admin -u root -p rootpassword
```

It will connect to localhost port 27017.

Note that `mongo` command should be installed on the computer. On Linux this should be install `mongodb-org-shell` only. Refer to this for more detail https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/installation/

## Some quick tips after logged-in
